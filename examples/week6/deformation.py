'''
TASK
- use begin_shape and end_shape to join the dots to make a circle. (HINT curve_vertex will make a smoother shape)
- make each point on the circle randomly walk so that it gradually deforms
- experiment with removing the ellipses and change the background refresh to build up static images of the deformation
- experiment with adding motion in a fixed direction to the points so that the pattern can be seen more clearly
- experiment with adding biases to random walks to create different effects
