TASK
- Annoyingly the circle doesn't close properly. Can you explain why?
- There's a straightforward solution to this problem using 2D noise. Can you work out what it is?
- Have a go at implementing it.
- Use a for loop to create concentric circles (like a tree trunk).
- Can you change the parameters to make these varied as the circles move outwards?
