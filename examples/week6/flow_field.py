TASK
- Add code to randomly reposition the particles when they go off canvas.
- Add code to change the colour of the particles based on the same or different noiseVals.
- Experiment with changing parameters such as noiseScale, octaves and falloff.
- Experiment with moving through the noise plane with incrementing values (in the flow function).
- Experiment with adding a third incrementing dimension to the noise plane (in the flow function).
