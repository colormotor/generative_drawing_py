    "##  Classes\n",
    "Python is an object oriented language, meaning that you can define \"things\" (i.e. objects) by creating classes. A class is like a blueprint or a template for creating objects. Imagine you’re building a car. A class would describe what a car is—how many wheels it has, what color it can be, and how it can move. But it’s not an instantiation of an actual car yet, it’s just the design for what an actual car could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class typically includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes**:\n",
    "These are like variables specific to the class or the objects created from the class.\n",
    "They describe the \"properties\" of an object. For example, a car’s color, brand, and number of wheels.\n",
    "Objects can have their own unique values for these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods**:\n",
    "These are like functions specific to the class and the objects created from it.\n",
    "They define the \"behaviors\" of the object—what the object can do or how it can interact with the world. For example, a car might have a `drive()` method or a `honk()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constructor**:\n",
    "This is a special method in Python (called `__init__`) that defines how to create an object (or instance) from the class.\n",
    "It allows you to set up attributes when an object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to JavaScript, defininig a class requires having access to a variable that internally refers to the instance of the class that has been created. In Python this variable is defined with a special attribute called `self` (as opposed to `this` used in JS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Differently from most Python code using lower-case and \"snake case\" (`snake_case`), the standard is to define classes in Python using a capital for the first letter of its name and camel case. E.g, we could define a class `FantasticCar`. A reader of the code usually knows that because of the capital, `FantasticCar` is a class name:\n"

    "\n",
    "The `update` method takes care of the motion of a particle and relies on a parameter `dt` that gives the time step for a tick of the simulation. In practice, the smaller this value, the more accurate the simulation would be. But we can use 1/60, taking into account the frame rate of a sketch. The procedure then consists of adding forces to the acceleration of the particle (e.g. gravity), adding the acceleration to the velocity of the particle, and finally adding the velocity to the position, thus resulting in the motion. We multiply by `dt` since velocity and accelerations are rates of change that depend on time, e.g. velocity is \"change in position per second\" and acceleration is \"change in velocity per second\".\n",
