"""
    Basic L-system implementation
  TASKS:
  - Modify the distance and angle parameters and the number of iterations and understand how these affect the drawing
  - Try inserting different rules and axioms
    + E.g. from here // https://fedimser.github.io/l-systems.html or other resources on the internet.
  - Examine the draw_l_system function. How can you add random variations to the drawing?
    + The result is known as a stochastic L-system
    + Use random_seed to avoid the drawing changing each frame
  - draw_turtle function currently draws a line. Modify this function to change how the L-system is visualized
  - Harder challenge: can you modify the L-system code so we also get information on the recursion depth for each symbol?
