TASKS
- This tree doesn't look very natural. Use random variation to make a more natural look. NB. random_seed will help you keep the variation consistent
- Experiment with using noise to animate the trees as if they are blowing in the wind
- Render multiple tree variants to make a small forest. NB. random_seed and noise_seed will help you generate distinct trees without the need to create many variables
