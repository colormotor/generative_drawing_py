'''
- experiment with changing the values inside the map function to make different minimum and maximum frequencies.
- experiment with incrementing freq_mod_phase by different amounts.  Make sure you understand why this changes the effect.
- This looks like a spring. Could you introduce a further modulation to make the spring expansion and contraction go faster and slower over time ?
- Can you change the carrier_freq variable to have a modulation that changes across the wave?
    - To do so do something similar to the amplitude modulation example
    - Add a `freq_mod_freq` variable and set it to something small 
    - Inside the `sin` controlling `carrier_freq` use
